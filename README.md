## What I learned
I am extremely satisfied with the development of **ShinyDex** ðŸ˜„, as it provided an opportunity for me to gain experience with a variety of powerful libraries and technologies.
Throughout the development process, I learned how to effectively implement user **authentication** and **database integration** using Django Rest Framework and Firebase, as well as how to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface with Vue.js and Tailwind.
I also gained valuable experience in **deploying** a full-stack web application using Python Anywhere, Github Pages and Amazon S3 for hosting images.
Overall, **ShinyDex** was a challenging and rewarding project that allowed me to expand my skill set and develop a greater appreciation for the power and versatility of modern web development frameworks and tools.
